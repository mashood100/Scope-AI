## üß† AI Integration Details

### Technology Extraction

The AI analyzes project descriptions to identify:

- Programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Dart, etc.)
- Frameworks (React, Flutter, Django, etc.)
- Databases (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Firebase, etc.)
- Cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.)
- Tools and libraries (Stripe, Socket.io, etc.)

### Vector Embeddings

- Uses OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model
- Generates 1536-dimensional vectors
- Enables semantic similarity search
- Cosine similarity calculation for matching

### Smart Categorization

Projects are automatically categorized into:

- **web_app**: Web applications and websites
- **mobile_app**: iOS, Android, and cross-platform apps
- **api**: Backend APIs and microservices
- **desktop_app**: Desktop applications
- **game**: Game development projects
- **ai_ml**: AI/ML and data science projects
- **other**: Miscellaneous projects

## üîÑ Integration with Proposal Generation

The portfolio system is designed to enhance proposal generation:

1. **Project Matching**: Use `/similar/` endpoint to find relevant projects
2. **Portfolio Integration**: Include matching projects in proposals
3. **Tailored Proposals**: Generate proposals based on similar past work
4. **Evidence-Based Bidding**: Reference specific projects in proposals

## üìù Usage Examples

### Creating a Flutter Project

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/proposals/api/portfolio/create/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Food Delivery App",
    "description": "Cross-platform Flutter app for food delivery with GPS tracking, real-time order updates, payment integration via Stripe, and push notifications. Uses Firebase for backend and GetX for state management.",
    "user_id": "freelancer123",
    "github_url": "https://github.com/user/food-delivery",
    "app_store_url": "https://apps.apple.com/app/food-delivery"
  }'
```

### Finding Similar Projects

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/proposals/api/portfolio/similar/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "job_description": "Need a mobile app developer for a restaurant ordering system with real-time tracking",
    "user_id": "freelancer123",
    "top_k": 2
  }'
```

### Getting User Portfolio

```bash
# All projects
curl http://localhost:8000/proposals/api/portfolio/user/freelancer123/

# Only mobile apps
curl "http://localhost:8000/proposals/api/portfolio/user/freelancer123/?project_type=mobile_app"

# Only featured projects
curl "http://localhost:8000/proposals/api/portfolio/user/freelancer123/?is_featured=true"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

1. **OpenAI API Key**: Required for AI analysis and embeddings
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL recommended for JSONField support
3. **Memory**: Vector embeddings require adequate memory for similarity calculations
4. **Processing Time**: Initial project creation takes 5-10 seconds due to AI analysis

## üö¶ Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling:

- **400 Bad Request**: Missing required fields or validation errors
- **404 Not Found**: Project not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: AI service failures or database errors

Example error response:

```json
{
  "error": "Project description must be at least 50 characters long"
}
```

## üéØ Future Enhancements

- **Batch Processing**: Analyze multiple projects simultaneously
- **Custom Training**: Fine-tune embeddings for specific domains
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search by tags, technologies, or complexity
- **Analytics**: Track project performance and similarity trends
- **Export Features**: Generate portfolio PDFs or presentations
